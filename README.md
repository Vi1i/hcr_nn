# hcr_nn
Handwritten Character Recognition using an Artifical Neural Networks

Notes:
* This only has one hidden layer
* This uses Sigmoid
* This is only set up to currently take in the specific data located in the data folder

TODO:
* Fix back propagation
* Update Doxygen comments for the hcr.hpp
* Allow the program to save the weights
* Allow the program to load already calculated weights
* Allow the program to choose between training and running
* Allow the program to verify loaded weights with the original data
